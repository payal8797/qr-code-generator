# Title: QR Code Generator with URL Validation

# Description:
The "QR Code Generator with URL Validation" project is a Python script that allows users to generate QR codes containing URLs. The script prompts users to input a URL and a filename for the QR code image. It validates the URL to ensure it follows the correct format using regular expressions (regex). If the URL is valid, the script generates a QR code image representing the URL and saves it with the provided filename.


# Key Features:

Input Validation: The script ensures that the provided URL is valid by checking its format using regex. This prevents the generation of QR codes with invalid URLs.

QR Code Generation: Using the qrcode library, the script generates a QR code image representing the provided URL.

Custom Filename: Users can specify a filename for the QR code image, allowing for customization and organization.

Error Handling: If the provided URL or filename is invalid, the script provides appropriate error messages and prompts the user to input valid information.

Flexibility: The script can be easily integrated into other projects or used as a standalone tool for generating QR codes with URLs.


# Steps to run:

To run the "QR Code Generator with URL Validation" project, follow these steps:

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and install the necessary libraries using pip:
    pip install qrcode[pil] validators

Download the Script: Download the Python script containing the QR code generator with URL validation from the source where it's available or create a new Python script and copy the code provided earlier.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script in your preferred Python environment (IDE, terminal, or Jupyter Notebook). Here are the steps to run the script:

    If you're using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or IDLE, open the script file in the IDE and run it.

    If you're using a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located and run the script using the Python interpreter:
        python qr_code_generator.py
    If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, copy the code cells containing the script into a new notebook and execute the cells.

Follow the Prompts: When the script runs, it will prompt you to input a URL and a filename for the QR code image. Enter the requested information as prompted.

Validation and QR Code Generation: The script will validate the URL and filename. If they are valid, it will generate the QR code image representing the URL and save it with the provided filename.

Check the Output: Once the script completes execution, check the directory where the script is located for the generated QR code image with the specified filename.

Repeat as Needed: You can run the script multiple times to generate QR codes with different URLs and filenames as needed.
